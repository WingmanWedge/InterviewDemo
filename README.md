Today we are going to perform a coding exercise. I have created a class that will recommend movies to users of our system. This class provides this in a function called "GetRecommendations". I will provide this class for you, as well as every class it references. I will also provide the unit test stubs.

We will work together to code the unit tests, and the Get Recommendation logic. I will provide clarity on any requirements as we go.

I wrote my code in C# with MS Test but you can use any IDE, language or test framework you prefer.
